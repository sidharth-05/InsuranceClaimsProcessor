# InsuranceClaimsProcessor
React-based SWE internship take-home: upload insurance claim docs, extract insured entity names via LLM, and match to internal IDs. PDF parsing incompleteâ€”manual text input to LLM works well.

# ðŸ§¾ Insurance Claim Parser

Built with **Next.js 14**, **React 18**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo**.
